# 🚘 Driver Drowsiness Detection System  
**Tech Stack:** Python, PyTorch, OpenCV (cv2), PIL, YOLOv8  

---

## 🧠 Overview  
The **Driver Drowsiness Detection System** is a real-time computer vision application designed to enhance road safety by monitoring the driver’s alertness.  
Using **YOLOv8** for face and eye detection, the system identifies signs of fatigue or drowsiness based on eye closure duration and triggers an alert to wake the driver.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Detect driver drowsiness in real time using computer vision.  
- Reduce road accidents caused by fatigue or inattention.  
- Provide a foundation for integrating driver monitoring systems in smart vehicles.  

---

## ⚙️ Features  
- Real-time face and eye detection using **YOLOv8**  
- Drowsiness classification based on **eye aspect ratio and blink duration**  
- Alarm or visual alert when drowsiness is detected  
- Modular and easy to extend for other ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) tasks
