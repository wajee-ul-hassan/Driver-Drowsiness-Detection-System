# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System-Python
Developed a real-time system that detects driver drowsiness using YOLOv8-based face and eye-state recognition, providing timely alerts to prevent accidents.

üß† Overview

The Driver Drowsiness Detection System is a real-time computer vision application designed to enhance road safety by monitoring the driver‚Äôs alertness.
Using YOLOv8 for face and eye detection, the system identifies signs of fatigue or drowsiness based on eye closure duration and triggers an alert to wake the driver.

üéØ Objectives

Detect driver drowsiness in real time using computer vision.

Reduce road accidents caused by fatigue or inattention.

Provide a foundation for integrating driver monitoring systems in smart vehicles.

‚öôÔ∏è Features

Real-time face and eye detection using YOLOv8

Drowsiness classification based on eye aspect ratio and blink duration

Alarm or visual alert when drowsiness is detected

Modular and easy to extend for other ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) tasks
